# üîë Environment Setup Summary

**What you need in your `.env.local` file**

---

## ‚úÖ TL;DR - What Changed?

**Nothing is required for existing setups!**

The system now supports:
1. **Platform defaults** (your existing env vars) - unchanged
2. **Per-agent integrations** (new, optional) - agents set up in UI

---

## üìã Your `.env.local` File

### Option A: Keep It Minimal (Agents BYOA)

```bash
# Required - Core Platform
CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=your_convex_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=https://your-project.convex.cloud
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_xxx
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_xxx
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-xxx

# Optional - Platform defaults (agents can override in UI)
RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxx                # Or leave empty - agents use their own
EMAIL_FROM=noreply@yourdomain.com    # Or leave empty
EMAIL_FROM_NAME=RealtorAI             # Or leave empty

TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=ACxxx             # Or leave empty - agents use their own
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=xxx                # Or leave empty  
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=+1xxx            # Or leave empty
```

**Result:**
- Platform provides fallback if agents don't connect
- Agents who connect integrations use their own accounts
- You only pay for agents who don't bring their own

---

### Option B: Full Platform Support (Traditional)

```bash
# Required - Core Platform
CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=your_convex_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=https://your-project.convex.cloud
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_xxx
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_xxx
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-xxx

# Platform-provided Email/SMS (all agents use this)
RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxx
EMAIL_FROM=noreply@yourdomain.com
EMAIL_FROM_NAME=YourPlatformName

TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=ACxxx
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=xxx
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=+1xxx
```

**Result:**
- All agents use platform account by default
- Agents CAN connect their own (optional)
- You pay for all email/SMS usage

---

### Option C: Hybrid (Recommended)

```bash
# Required - Core Platform
CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=your_convex_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=https://your-project.convex.cloud
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_xxx
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_xxx
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-xxx

# Email - Platform provides free tier default
RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxx                # Your Resend free account
EMAIL_FROM=noreply@yourdomain.com
EMAIL_FROM_NAME=YourPlatform

# SMS - No platform default (agents must connect own)
# TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=                # Leave empty = simulation mode
# TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=
# TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=
```

**Result:**
- Platform provides email for agents who don't connect
- Agents MUST connect Twilio for SMS (or campaigns simulate)
- Best cost control for SMS

---

## üéØ What Each Approach Costs

### Option A: Minimal (BYOA)
```
Platform: $0/month for email/SMS APIs
Agents: Each pays $0-10/month (most free tier)
Best for: Startups wanting zero API costs
```

### Option B: Full Platform
```
Platform: $50-500/month for all agents
Agents: $0
Best for: Established platforms with budget
```

### Option C: Hybrid (Recommended)
```
Platform: $0/month (free email tier)
Agents: $0-10/month for SMS (if they want SMS)
Best for: Most platforms - balance of control & cost
```

---

## üöÄ Recommendation for You

Based on your current setup, I recommend **Option C: Hybrid**

### What to do in `.env.local`:

```bash
# Keep your existing required keys
CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=...
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=...
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=...

# Add/keep email provider
RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxx              # Sign up at resend.com (free)
EMAIL_FROM=noreply@yourdomain.com
EMAIL_FROM_NAME=RealtorAI

# REMOVE or comment out Twilio (let agents provide)
# TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=
# TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=  
# TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=
```

### Why?
- ‚úì Email works out of box (platform Resend free tier)
- ‚úì Zero platform cost for SMS (agents bring own)
- ‚úì Agents get professional branding
- ‚úì You stay in Resend's 100 free/day limit
- ‚úì Best of both worlds

---

## üìù Setup Steps

### 1. For Email (2 minutes):

If you don't have Resend yet:

```bash
1. Go to resend.com/signup
2. Sign up (no credit card)
3. Get API key
4. Add to .env.local:
   RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxxx
   EMAIL_FROM=noreply@yourdomain.com
   EMAIL_FROM_NAME=RealtorAI
```

### 2. For SMS (Optional):

Leave empty or comment out:
```bash
# Agents will connect their own Twilio accounts
# TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=
# TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=
# TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=
```

### 3. Tell Your Agents:

"Email works automatically. For SMS campaigns, connect your Twilio account in Settings ‚Üí Integrations (2-min setup)"

## ‚ùì FAQ

### Q: Do I need to change my existing `.env.local`?
**A:** No! Everything is backwards compatible. Add new features when ready.

### Q: What if I don't add Resend?
**A:** System works in simulation mode (logs to console). Agents can connect their own.

### Q: What if I already have Resend configured?
**A:** Perfect! Keep it. Agents without own accounts will use yours.

### Q: Do agents HAVE to connect integrations?
**A:** No! It's optional. They'll use platform defaults (your env vars).

### Q: Can I force agents to use their own accounts?
**A:** Just leave platform env vars empty. They'll have to connect or campaigns simulate.

### Q: What about existing agents?
**A:** Zero impact. They keep working with platform defaults until they choose to connect their own.

---

## üéâ Summary

**Bottom Line:**
- Your existing `.env.local` still works
- New features are additive, not breaking
- Agents can optionally bring own accounts
- You choose: provide platform defaults or make agents BYOA

**Recommended Next Step:**
1. Keep your existing setup as-is
2. Test that email works (with your Resend or simulation)
3. Tell agents they CAN connect own accounts (Settings ‚Üí Integrations)
4. Monitor adoption over time
5. Adjust platform defaults based on what agents do

**No urgent changes needed! System is backwards compatible. üöÄ**
