# Sidebar Navigation Cleanup

## Issue
Clicking on "AI Assistant", "Reports", "Documents", "Settings", or "Get Help" in the sidebar just added `#` to the URL and did nothing.

## Root Cause
These were placeholder links from the starter template that weren't relevant to the real estate platform.

## What Was Fixed

### Removed Placeholder Navigation Items:

**Before:**
```typescript
documents: [
  { name: "AI Assistant", url: "#", icon: IconBrandOpenai },
  { name: "Reports", url: "#", icon: IconReport },
  { name: "Documents", url: "#", icon: IconFileDescription },
],
navSecondary: [
  { title: "Settings", url: "#", icon: IconSettings },
  { title: "Get Help", url: "#", icon: IconHelp },
],
```

**After:**
```typescript
documents: [
  // Removed placeholder links - not needed for real estate platform
],
navSecondary: [
  // Optional: Can add Settings and Help pages later
],
```

### Updated Branding:

**Before:**
- App name: "Starter DIY"
- Badge: "Demo"
- Logo link: "/" (homepage)

**After:**
- App name: "Deal Finder"
- Badge: "Agent"
- Logo link: "/dashboard" (agent dashboard)

## Current Navigation Structure

### Main Navigation (Working):
✅ **Dashboard** → `/dashboard`  
✅ **My Listings** → `/dashboard/listings`  
✅ **Buyers** → `/dashboard/buyers`  
✅ **Sellers** → `/dashboard/sellers`

### Footer:
✅ **User Profile** → Clerk user menu (sign out, etc.)

### Documents Section:
- *Empty* (can add features later if needed)

### Secondary Navigation:
- *Empty* (can add settings/help pages later if needed)

## What You Can Add Later (Optional)

If you want these features, you can create:

### Settings Page (`/dashboard/settings`)
```typescript
{
  title: "Settings",
  url: "/dashboard/settings",
  icon: IconSettings,
}
```

Potential settings:
- Agent profile editing
- Notification preferences
- API key management
- Branding customization
- Email templates

### Help/Support Page (`/dashboard/help`)
```typescript
{
  title: "Help & Support",
  url: "/dashboard/help",
  icon: IconHelp,
}
```

Could include:
- Documentation links
- Video tutorials
- Contact support form
- FAQ
- Live chat support

### Reports Page (`/dashboard/reports`)
```typescript
{
  title: "Reports",
  url: "/dashboard/reports",
  icon: IconReport,
}
```

Could show:
- Monthly performance reports
- Lead conversion stats
- Property analytics
- Revenue tracking
- Export to PDF/Excel

### Documents Center (`/dashboard/documents`)
```typescript
{
  title: "Documents",
  url: "/dashboard/documents",
  icon: IconFileDescription,
}
```

Could manage:
- Property disclosures
- Contracts and agreements
- Marketing materials
- Client documents
- E-signatures

## Current Status

✅ **All working navigation items functional**  
✅ **No broken links**  
✅ **Cleaner, focused sidebar**  
✅ **Real estate platform branding**

The sidebar now shows only the core real estate features that are built and working.
