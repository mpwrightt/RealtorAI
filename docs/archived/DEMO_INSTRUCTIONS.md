**Buyer Portal:**
> "This is what your buyer sees - a personalized property portal with no login required. Notice how the AI can answer detailed questions about properties, comparables, and market trends. It's pulling real data from MLS APIs and presenting it in an easy-to-understand format."

**AI Interaction:**
> "Watch this - I'll ask about comparable properties. See how the AI shows exactly what it's doing? It's calling the RentCast API, getting real comp data, and explaining it naturally. This transparency builds trust with clients."

**Seller Portal:**
> "For sellers, they get this analytics dashboard showing exactly how much interest their property is getting. They can see every viewing, track offers, and stay informed throughout the process."

**Agent Dashboard:**
> "And here's your command center. All your listings, all your buyer and seller sessions in one place. Creating a new session is as simple as entering their info and sending them a link."
