**Date:** January 16, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Build:** ✅ Passing

---

## 🎯 What Was Done

### 1. Removed Hardcoded Access Control
**Before:** Demo data creation was limited to a single hardcoded email address
```typescript
// OLD CODE - Hardcoded
if (args.email !== "mawrigh602@gmail.com") {
  throw new Error("Unauthorized");
}
```

**After:** Now controlled by feature flag (accessible to all admins)
```typescript
// NEW CODE - Feature flag controlled
const demoFlag = await ctx.db
  .query("featureFlags")
  .withIndex("by_key", (q) => q.eq("key", "demo_mode"))
  .unique();

if (!demoFlag?.enabled) {
  throw new Error("Demo mode is disabled. Enable it in admin panel first.");
}
```

### 2. Moved Demo Mode to Admin Panel
**Created:** `/admin/demo` route with full demo management UI

**Features:**
- Toggle demo mode on/off via feature flag
- Generate comprehensive test data
- Clear demo data
- View and copy session links
- Stats display (listings, buyers, sellers)
- Direct links to buyer/seller portals

### 3. Added Demo Mode Feature Flag
**New Flag:** `demo_mode`
- **Category:** System
- **Default:** Disabled (for safety)
- **Description:** "Allow generation of test/demo data for presentations"

### 4. Updated Admin Navigation
Added "Demo Mode" to admin sidebar:
- Icon: Sparkles (✨)
- Route: `/admin/demo`
- Accessible to all admins
