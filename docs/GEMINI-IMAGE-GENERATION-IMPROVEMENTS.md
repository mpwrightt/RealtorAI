# Gemini Image Generation - Cookbook Improvements

Based on the official [Gemini Image Generation Cookbook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Image_out.ipynb).

## ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Ready for Testing!)

**Date:** January 2025

We've implemented the cookbook's recommended best practices:

1. **Response Modalities** - Set to `['IMAGE']` for all image generation
   - Faster generation (no text processing needed)
   - More efficient token usage
   
2. **Aspect Ratio Control** - All photos now use `16:9` aspect ratio
   - Street View synthesis: 16:9 (1344x768)
   - Street View enhancement: 16:9 (1344x768)
   - Satellite/aerial enhancement: 16:9 (1344x768)
   - Professional real estate standard
   
**Result:** All generated images are now 16:9 aspect ratio (1344x768 pixels), perfect for real estate listings and marketing materials!

## Current Implementation Status

✅ **Already Implemented:**
- Using `gemini-2.5-flash-image` model
- Passing images as `inlineData` with base64
- Using temperature controls (0.3-0.6)
- Multi-image input (Street View angles, satellite zooms)

## Recommended Improvements

### 1. Response Modalities (High Priority)

**What:** Explicitly set `responseModalities` in generation config

**Why:** The cookbook shows this gives better control over output type

**Implementation:**
```typescript
generationConfig: {
  temperature: 0.4,
  responseModalities: ['image'], // Only return images, no text
  // OR
  responseModalities: ['image', 'text'], // Return both
}
```

**Benefit:** Faster generation when we don't need text responses

---

### 2. Aspect Ratio Control (High Priority)

**What:** Set aspect ratio for professional real estate photos

**Why:** Real estate photos look best in 16:9 or 4:3 aspect ratios

**Available Ratios:**
| Aspect Ratio | Resolution | Best For |
|--------------|------------|----------|
| `16:9` | 1344x768 | Exterior shots, landscapes |
| `4:3` | 1184x864 | Interior rooms |
| `3:2` | 1248x832 | Standard photography |
| `1:1` | 1024x1024 | Social media, thumbnails |

**Implementation:**
```typescript
import { ImageConfig } from '@google/generative-ai';

generationConfig: {
  imageConfig: {
    aspectRatio: '16:9', // For exterior shots
    // OR
    aspectRatio: '4:3', // For interior photos
  },
}
```

**Benefit:** Professional aspect ratios that match real estate standards

### 3. Chat Mode for Iterative Editing (Medium Priority)

**What:** Use chat sessions instead of unary calls

**Why:** Cookbook says "Chat mode (recommended method)" for iterative improvements

**Current:** We use `generateContent()` for each image

**Better:** Use chat sessions for refinement:
```typescript
const chat = client.chats.create({ model: 'gemini-2.5-flash-image' });

// First generation
const response1 = await chat.sendMessage([
  'Create professional real estate photo',
  imageData
]);

// Iterative improvement
const response2 = await chat.sendMessage(
  'Remove the car in the driveway'
);

const response3 = await chat.sendMessage(
  'Make the lighting warmer and more golden hour'
);
```

**Benefit:** 
- Better context retention across edits
- Can refine images without re-uploading
- More efficient token usage

**Use Case:** Could add a "refine photo" feature where agents can request specific changes

---

### 4. Google Maps Transformation Prompts (Low Priority)

**What:** Use cookbook's proven prompts for map transformations

**Cookbook Example:**
```
"Show me what we see from the red arrow"
```

**Our Current Approach:** Works well, but could be more specific

**Potential Improvement:**
```typescript
const prompt = `This is a Google Maps satellite view of a property.
Show me what this property looks like from ground level,
as if I'm standing in the front yard looking at the house.

Transform this aerial view into a professional ground-level photograph.`;
```

---

### 5. Image Fusion Best Practices (Low Priority)

**What:** Better handling of multiple image inputs

**Cookbook Tip:** "Combine multiple images into a single 'collage' first if you need to go beyond the image upload limit"

**Current:** We send up to 4 Street View angles directly

**Consideration:** If we ever hit limits, we could:
1. Stitch images into a grid first
2. Send the grid as reference
3. Ask AI to synthesize from the grid

**Note:** Not needed now, but good to know for future

## Implementation Priority

### High Priority (COMPLETED! ✅)
1. ✅ Add `responseModalities: ['IMAGE']` to all image generation calls
2. ✅ Add `aspectRatio: '16:9'` for Street View photos
3. ✅ Add `aspectRatio: '16:9'` for satellite/aerial photos
4. ⏳ Add `aspectRatio: '4:3'` for interior photos (future when we add interior analysis)

### Medium Priority (Nice to Have)
4. ⏳ Implement chat mode for "refine photo" feature
5. ⏳ Allow agents to request specific edits after generation

### Low Priority (Future Enhancement)
6. ⏳ A/B test different prompts based on cookbook examples
7. ⏳ Add image collage pre-processing if needed

---

## Quick Wins

### Update 1: Add Response Modalities
```typescript
// In enhanceStreetViewImage()
generationConfig: {
  temperature: 0.4,
  topP: 0.95,
  topK: 40,
  responseModalities: ['image'], // NEW: Only return images
}
```

### Update 2: Add Aspect Ratio for Exteriors
```typescript
// In synthesizePropertyPhoto()
generationConfig: {
  temperature: 0.4,
  responseModalities: ['image'],
  imageConfig: {
    aspectRatio: '16:9', // NEW: Professional exterior ratio
  },
}
```

### Update 3: Add Aspect Ratio for Satellite
```typescript
// In satelliteToGroundLevel()
generationConfig: {
  temperature: 0.3,
  responseModalities: ['image'],
  imageConfig: {
    aspectRatio: '16:9', // NEW: Aerial shots look best in 16:9
  },
}
```

---

## Testing Recommendations

Before implementing:
1. Test aspect ratios on different property types
2. Measure generation time with/without responseModalities
3. Compare quality of current vs. cookbook-optimized prompts

After implementing:
1. A/B test with real agents
2. Monitor generation costs
3. Track quality improvements

## Questions for User

1. Do you want to add aspect ratio control now?
2. Should we implement chat mode for photo refinement?
3. Do you want agents to be able to request specific edits to generated photos?
