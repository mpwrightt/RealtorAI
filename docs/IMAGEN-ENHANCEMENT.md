# Gemini 2.5 Flash Image: AI Property Photo Enhancement

## Overview

This feature uses **Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash Image** (via Google AI Studio) to automatically enhance property photos by:

1. **Enhancing Street View images** - Transform basic Google Street View photos into professional-quality listing images
2. **Satellite-to-Ground transformation** - Convert Google Earth aerial/satellite views into realistic ground-level backyard shots

## ✅ Current Status: READY TO TEST

The implementation is **complete** and uses the same Google AI Studio API key as Gemini analysis.

### What Works Now:
- ✅ Google Street View image fetching
- ✅ Google Earth/satellite image fetching  
- ✅ Gemini photo analysis (gemini-1.5-flash)
- ✅ Image enhancement implementation (gemini-2.5-flash-image)
- ✅ Image-to-image editing with proper prompts
- ✅ Fallback to original images on error

### No Additional Setup Required:
Uses the same `GOOGLE_AI_STUDIO_API_KEY` - just set `GOOGLE_IMAGE_MODEL=gemini-2.5-flash-image` in your `.env.local`

## Intelligent Angle Selection (NEW!)

We now use **AI-powered object detection** to automatically select the best Street View angles before enhancing:

### The Problem
- Previously: Enhanced all 4 Street View angles blindly
- Cost: 4 × $0.05 = $0.20 per listing
- Issue: Some angles show roads/trees, not the house!

### The Solution
1. **Fetch 4 Street View angles** (front, right, left, side)
2. **Run object detection** on each angle (Roboflow API or fallback heuristics)
3. **Score each angle** (0-100 based on building presence, confidence, size)
4. **Select top 2 angles** with best scores
5. **Only enhance the best 2** → 50% cost savings!

### Scoring Algorithm
```
Score = Base (40) + Confidence (40) + Size (20)

- Has building: +40 points
- Building confidence: 0-40 points  
- Building size (20-70% of image): +20 points
```

### Detection Methods

**Option 1: Roboflow API (Recommended)**
- Pre-trained building detection model
- Accurate object detection
- Cost: $0.01 per image × 4 = $0.04/listing
- Setup: Just add `ROBOFLOW_API_KEY` to `.env.local`

**Option 2: Simple Heuristics (Free Fallback)**
- No API needed, always available
- Uses heading-based scoring
- Prefers front/diagonal views
- Confidence: 0.6-0.8

### Cost Analysis

**Before intelligent selection:**
- 4 angles × $0.05 = $0.20
- Some angles don't show house

**After intelligent selection (with Roboflow):**
- Detection: 4 × $0.01 = $0.04
- Enhancement: 2 × $0.05 = $0.10
- Total: $0.14/listing
- **Savings: 30%**

**With fallback (no Roboflow):**
- Detection: $0.00 (free heuristics)
- Enhancement: 2 × $0.05 = $0.10
- Total: $0.10/listing
- **Savings: 50%**

## How It Works (Implementation)

### 1. Street View Enhancement

**Input:** Basic Google Street View photo (often blurry, poor lighting)
```
┌─────────────────────┐
│  Street View Photo  │
│  - Basic quality    │
│  - Flat lighting    │
│  - Compression      │
└─────────────────────┘
         ↓
    Imagen 3.0 Enhancement
         ↓
┌─────────────────────┐
│  Enhanced Photo     │
│  - Professional     │
│  - Better lighting  │
│  - Sharp & clear    │
└─────────────────────┘
```

**Enhancements:**
- Improved lighting and color balance
- Enhanced clarity and sharpness
- Professional real estate photography style
- Warm, inviting atmosphere
- **Maintains** original composition (ethical)

### 2. Satellite/Aerial Image Enhancement

**Two Modes Available:**

#### Mode 1: Aerial Enhancement (Default - Recommended)
```
┌─────────────────────┐
│  Satellite View     │
│  (Bird's eye)       │
│  Low quality, dull  │
└─────────────────────┘
         ↓
    Gemini Enhancement
         ↓
┌─────────────────────┐
│  Enhanced Aerial    │
│  (Still bird's eye) │
│  Sharp, vibrant,    │
│  professional drone │
└─────────────────────┘
```

**What it does:**
- KEEPS the aerial/bird's-eye perspective
- Enhances clarity, sharpness, and color
- Makes it look like professional drone photography
- Most accurate - no perspective transformation
- Best for showing property layout from above

#### Mode 2: Ground-Level Transformation (Experimental)
```
┌─────────────────────┐
│  Satellite View     │
│  (Bird's eye)       │
│  Shows: Pool, deck  │
└─────────────────────┘
         ↓
    Perspective Transform
         ↓
┌─────────────────────┐
│  Ground-Level Shot  │
│  (Standing in yard) │
│  Shows: Backyard    │
└─────────────────────┘
```

**What it does:**
- Converts aerial to ground-level view
- Shows backyard from standing height
- More creative, but may be less accurate
- Experimental AI transformation

**How to Switch Modes:**
```bash
# In .env.local
SATELLITE_ENHANCEMENT_MODE=aerial-enhance  # Default, recommended
# OR
SATELLITE_ENHANCEMENT_MODE=ground-level     # Experimental
```

## Setup (Already Complete!)

### Environment Variables

Add to `.env.local`:
```bash
# Same API key for both analysis and image generation
GOOGLE_AI_STUDIO_API_KEY=your_google_ai_studio_api_key

# Image generation model
GOOGLE_IMAGE_MODEL=gemini-2.5-flash-image
```

That's it! No additional APIs, no Vertex AI, no extra billing setup.

## API Costs

### Gemini 2.5 Flash Image Pricing
Based on Google AI Studio pricing (as of 2024):
- **Image generation/editing:** ~$0.04-0.06 per image
- **Much simpler billing** than Vertex AI Imagen

### Cost Per Listing
Assuming we enhance:
- 1 Street View front photo: ~$0.05
- 1 Satellite-to-ground backyard: ~$0.05
- **Total:** ~$0.10 per listing

Combined with photo analysis:
- Gemini analysis (10 photos): ~$0.01
- Image enhancement (2 photos): ~$0.10
- **Grand total:** ~$0.11 per listing

**Still incredibly cost-effective vs. hiring a photographer ($100-300)**

## Ethical Considerations

✅ **Acceptable:**
- Enhancing existing real photos (lighting, clarity)
- Transforming satellite views to ground perspective
- Improving photo quality professionally

❌ **Not Acceptable:**
- Adding features that don't exist (fake pools, additions)
