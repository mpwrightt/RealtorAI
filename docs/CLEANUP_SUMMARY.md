## 📈 Maintenance Tips

### Adding New Docs:
1. **Completion docs** → `docs/completed-features/`
2. **Reference guides** → `docs/active-guides/`
3. **Implementation plans** → `docs/implementation-plans/`
4. **Old/historical** → `docs/archived/`

### Working on Phases:
1. **Starting work:** Move from `future-phases/` to `in-progress-phases/`
2. **Finishing work:** Move from `in-progress-phases/` to `completed-phases/`
3. **Planning new phase:** Create in `future-phases/`

### Keep Root Clean:
- Only core project docs (README, CLAUDE, AGENTS, AG-UI)
- Everything else goes in `docs/` or `plan/`

## 🎊 Result

**From chaos to clarity in < 5 minutes!**

Your documentation is now:
- ✅ Well-organized
- ✅ Easy to navigate
