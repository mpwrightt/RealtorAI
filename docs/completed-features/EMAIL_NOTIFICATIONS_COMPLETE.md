## üîß Technical Implementation

### Environment Variables

Added to `.env.local.example`:
```bash
# Resend - 100 free emails/day, 3000/month
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_resend_api_key_here
EMAIL_FROM=noreply@yourdomain.com
EMAIL_FROM_NAME=RealtorAI
```

### Files Created

1. **`lib/email/templates.ts`**
   - 5 email templates
   - HTML + text versions
   - Professional styling
   - Responsive design
   - Branded headers/footers

2. **`lib/email/send.ts`**
   - Send Email service
   - Resend API integration
   - Simulation mode
   - Error handling

   - Email validation

3. **`convex/emailNotifications.ts`**
   - 3 Convex actions
   - Query all necessary data
   - Check notification preferences
   - Handle errors gracefully
   - Logging for debugging

### How It Works

**1. Event Occurs:**
```typescript
// Agent creates buyer session
const sessionId = await createBuyerSession({ ... });
```

**2. Trigger Email:**
```typescript
// Optionally send welcome email
await sendBuyerWelcomeEmail({ buyerSessionId: sessionId });
```

**3. Email Sent:**
- System queries all needed data
- Checks notification preferences
- Generates email from template
- Sends via Resend API
- Returns success/error

**Simulation Mode:**
If `RESEND_API_KEY` not set:

  buyerSessionId: session._id
});

// Send seller welcome

});

await executeAction(api.emailNotifications.sendNewOfferEmail, {
  offerId: offer._id
});
```

### Automatic Triggering

Add to your mutations:

```typescript
// In buyerSessions.ts
export const createBuyerSession = mutation({
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    const sessionId = await ctx.db.insert("buyerSessions", { ... });
    
    // Trigger welcome email
    await ctx.scheduler.runAfter(0, api.emailNotifications.sendBuyerWelcomeEmail, {
      buyerSessionId: sessionId
    });
    
    return sessionId;
  }
});
