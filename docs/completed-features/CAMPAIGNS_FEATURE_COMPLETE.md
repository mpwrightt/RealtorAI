## 🔧 How It Works

### Priority Cascade

**Email Sending:**
```
1. Agent's connected integration (Resend/SendGrid/Mailgun)
   ↓ (if not connected)
2. Agent's branding settings (custom company name, reply-to)
   ↓ (if not set)
3. Platform environment variables (RESEND_API_KEY)
   ↓ (if not set)
4. Simulation mode (development)
```

**SMS Sending:**
```
1. Agent's connected Twilio account
   ↓ (if not connected)
2. Agent's branding SMS phone number
   ↓ (if not set)
3. Platform Twilio credentials (env vars)
   ↓ (if not set)
4. Simulation mode (development)
```

### Example Scenarios

**Agent with Full Integration:**
```typescript
Email: Uses their SendGrid account
  From: Wright Realty <matt@wrightrealty.com>
  Via: Agent's SendGrid API key
  Logs: Visible in agent's SendGrid dashboard

SMS: Uses their Twilio account
  From: +1-555-WRIGHT
  Via: Agent's Twilio credentials
  Cost: Agent pays $0.01/SMS
```

**Agent with Only Branding:**
```typescript
Email: Uses platform Resend
  From: Wright Realty <noreply@platform.com>
  Via: Platform's RESEND_API_KEY
  Logs: Visible in platform dashboard

SMS: Uses platform Twilio
  From: +1-555-WRIGHT (agent's custom number)
  Via: Platform's TWILIO credentials
  Cost: Platform pays
```

**Agent with Nothing Custom:**
```typescript
Email: Uses platform defaults
  From: RealtorAI <noreply@platform.com>
  Via: Platform's RESEND_API_KEY

SMS: Uses platform defaults
  From: +1-555-PLATFORM
  Via: Platform's TWILIO credentials
```

## 🔒 Security Notes

### Current Implementation
⚠️ **API keys stored in plaintext** - Acceptable for MVP/demo

### Production Recommendations
```typescript
// Add encryption layer
import { encrypt, decrypt } from '@/lib/crypto';

// Before storing
const encrypted = await encrypt(apiKey, process.env.ENCRYPTION_KEY);

// Before using  
const decrypted = await decrypt(encrypted, process.env.ENCRYPTION_KEY);
```

**TODO for Production:**
- [ ] Implement encryption at rest
- [ ] Add API key rotation
- [ ] Add webhook verification
- [ ] Add integration health checks
- [ ] Add usage quotas/warnings
