## üìù Technical Notes

### AI Marketing Implementation:
```typescript
// Uses OpenRouter with Claude 3.5 Sonnet
const generator = new MarketingGenerator();
const content = await generator.generateFullMarketing(listing);

// Returns structured JSON:
{
  listingDescription: string,
  socialMediaPosts: {
    facebook: string,
    instagram: string,
    twitter: string
  },
  emailTemplate: string,
  hashtags: string[]
}
```

### Fallback Strategy:
- If OpenRouter API fails ‚Üí uses template generation
- If API key missing ‚Üí uses templates
- Templates still generate quality content
- AI is enhancement, not requirement

### Performance:
- AI generation: 10-15 seconds
- Template generation: Instant
- Caching: Campaign saved to database
- Regeneration: Anytime (updates existing)
