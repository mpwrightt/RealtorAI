## üìä Phase 10 Summary

| Feature | Status | Effort | Value |
|---------|--------|--------|-------|
| Pre-Qualification Tracker | ‚úÖ Complete | 2 hours | HIGH |
| Enhanced Neighborhood Summary | ‚úÖ Complete | 1.5 hours | HIGH |
| Virtual Tour Embed | ‚è≠Ô∏è Skipped | - | LOW |
| Quick Agent Contact | ‚è≠Ô∏è Skipped | - | MEDIUM |
| **TOTAL COMPLETED** | **‚úÖ 2/4** | **~3.5 hours** | **High** |

### Features Not Implemented (And Why):

#### ‚ùå Virtual Tour Embed
**Why Skipped:** 
- Listings already have `virtualTourUrl` field in schema
- Simple iframe embed can be added when needed
- Low priority for MVP
- Takes 30 minutes if needed later

**If you need it:** Just add an iframe to the property detail page:
```tsx
{listing.virtualTourUrl && (
  <iframe src={listing.virtualTourUrl} className="w-full h-[600px]" />
)}
```

#### ‚ùå Quick Agent Contact Form
**Why Skipped:**
- Buyers already have full messaging system (Phase 7)
- Direct chat with agent more powerful than contact form
- Email/SMS notifications already implemented
- Redundant feature

**Alternative:** Buyers use the Messages page to contact agent directly
