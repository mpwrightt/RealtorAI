# AG-UI Integration Complete! âœ…

## What is AG-UI?

**AG-UI (Agent-UI Protocol)** provides transparent, real-time interaction between AI agents and users. It shows:
- **Live streaming** of AI responses
- **Tool calls in action** - See when the AI uses tools like "search_comparable_properties" or "calculate_mortgage"
- **Tool results** - View the actual data returned from each tool
- **Conversation history** - Full transcript with all messages and tool calls

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **AG-UI Streaming API** (`app/api/ag-ui/stream/route.ts`)
   - Server-Sent Events (SSE) endpoint
   - Streams AI responses in real-time
   - Emits events for:
     - `message` - User/assistant messages
     - `content` - Streaming response chunks
     - `tool_call` - When AI decides to use a tool
     - `tool_result` - Tool execution results
     - `tool_error` - If a tool fails
     - `state_update` - Session state changes
     - `done` - Stream complete
     - `error` - Stream errors

### 2. **AG-UI React Hook** (`hooks/use-ag-ui-stream.ts`)
   - `useAGUIStream()` - Manages streaming state
   - Handles SSE event parsing
   - Accumulates messages and events
   - Provides controls: `startStream`, `stopStream`, `clearHistory`
   - Returns: `events`, `messages`, `currentMessage`, `activeTool`, `isStreaming`

### 3. **AG-UI Transcript Component** (`components/ag-ui/transcript.tsx`)
   - Beautiful visual representation of conversation
   - Shows user messages (right-aligned, blue)
   - Shows AI responses (left-aligned, gray)
   - **Tool call visualization:**
     - Spinner while tool is running
     - Green checkmark when complete
     - Red X if error occurs
     - Expandable details showing tool results
   - Auto-scrolls to latest message

### 4. **Enhanced Chat Widget** (`components/ag-ui/enhanced-chat-widget.tsx`)
   - Floating chat button (bottom-right)
   - Expandable chat window (400px Ã— 600px)
   - Uses AG-UI transcript for messages
   - Shows active tool indicator
   - Clear conversation button
   - Stop streaming button
   - Suggestion prompts when empty

### 5. **RealEstateAgent Stream Support** (`lib/openrouter/real-estate-agent.ts`)
   - New `streamChat()` method with callbacks:
     - `onContent` - Called for each chunk of text
     - `onToolCall` - Called when AI uses a tool
     - `onComplete` - Called when stream finishes
   - Accumulates tool calls during streaming
   - Executes tools and returns results

### 6. **Integrated with Buyer Portal**
   - Property detail pages now use Enhanced Chat Widget
   - Chat has full property context (address, price, beds, etc.)
   - AI can answer property-specific questions
   - Tools are context-aware

## How It Works

### User Flow:
1. User opens property detail page
2. Clicks floating chat button (bottom-right)
3. Types question: "What are the schools like nearby?"
4. **AG-UI Magic:**
   - Message appears immediately (user message)
   - AI starts streaming response
   - User sees: "Looking up school information for you..."
   - Tool call appears: `get_school_ratings` (with spinner)
   - Tool result shows: School data with ratings
   - Tool completes (green checkmark)
   - AI continues streaming final answer with school analysis
   - Response completes

### Behind the Scenes:
```
Client â†’ POST /api/ag-ui/stream â†’ RealEstateAgent.streamChat()
  â†“
AI decides to use tool â†’ executeToolCall() â†’ Real data (or mock)
  â†“
Stream result back â†’ Client receives events â†’ Update UI
  â†“
Done â†’ Show complete message with all tool calls visible
```

## Available Tools

The AI can use these tools transparently:

1. **search_comparable_properties** - Find similar properties nearby
2. **calculate_mortgage** - Calculate monthly payments
3. **get_school_ratings** - Get nearby school information
4. **get_walk_score** - Get walkability, transit, bike scores
5. **get_nearby_amenities** - Find restaurants, shops, parks
6. **analyze_market_trends** - Get market analysis and pricing trends

## Example Conversations

### Example 1: School Information
**User:** "What are the schools like nearby?"

**AI Tool Call:** `get_school_ratings`
```json
{
  "address": "123 Main Street",
  "radius": 1
}
```

**Tool Result:**
```json
{
  "elementary": [
    { "name": "Lincoln Elementary", "rating": 9, "distance": "0.3 miles" }
  ],
  "middle": [...],
  "high": [...]
}
```

**AI Response:** "The schools in this area are excellent! Lincoln Elementary (9/10 rating) is just 0.3 miles away..."

### Example 2: Mortgage Calculation
**User:** "What would my monthly payment be?"

**AI Tool Call:** `calculate_mortgage`
```json
{
  "principal": 1250000,
  "downPayment": 250000,
  "interestRate": 7.0,
  "loanTermYears": 30
}
```

**Tool Result:**
```json
{
  "monthlyPayment": 6653.09,
  "breakdown": {
    "principal": 2777.78,
    "interest": 3875.31
  }
}
```

**AI Response:** "With a 20% down payment ($250,000), your monthly payment would be approximately $6,653..."

## Testing the AG-UI

### 1. Start the Application
```bash
npm run dev
npx convex dev
```

### 2. Create Test Data
- Sign in to `/dashboard`
- Fill agent onboarding form
- Click "Create Test Data"

### 3. Open Buyer Portal
- Click the buyer portal link from test data
- Go to a property detail page
- Click the chat button (bottom-right)

### 4. Try These Questions:
- "What are the schools like nearby?"
- "Calculate the monthly mortgage for me"
- "What's the walkability score?"
- "Show me comparable properties"
- "What are the market trends in this area?"

### 5. Watch the Magic!
- See messages stream in real-time
- Watch tool calls appear with spinners
- Expand tool results to see raw data
- See how AI uses tools to answer questions

## Enabling Real AI (Optional)

Currently using mock tool responses. To enable real AI:

### 1. Add OpenRouter API Key
```env
# .env.local
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-...
```

### 2. Add Real API Keys for Tools (Optional)
```env
MLS_API_KEY=your_mls_key
MAPBOX_API_KEY=your_mapbox_key
WALKSCORE_API_KEY=your_walkscore_key
```

### 3. Update Tool Handlers
Edit `lib/openrouter/tool-handlers.ts` to make real API calls instead of returning mock data.

## Architecture Benefits

### Transparency
- Users see exactly what the AI is doing
- Tool calls are visible and understandable
- No "black box" - everything is transparent

### Debug-Friendly
- Easy to see what tools are being called
- Can inspect tool arguments and results
- Stream events available in browser DevTools

### User Trust
- Users trust AI more when they see how it works
- Visible tool usage builds confidence
- Clear indication when AI is "thinking" vs "retrieving data"

### Developer Experience

3. **Interactive UI Components** - AI-generated property cards, charts
4. **State Inspector** - View current agent state and context
5. **Event Export** - Download conversation logs for analysis

### Phase 7: Testing & Polish
- Comprehensive testing of all features
- Performance optimization
- Error handling improvements
