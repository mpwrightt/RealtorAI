# Admin Security Test Guide 🔒

**Date:** January 16, 2025  
**Priority:** 🔴 Critical - Test Before Deploying  
**Status:** Ready for Testing

## 🎯 What Changed

### The Fix
**Before:** Index-based query wasn't catching all admins (role might be undefined)

**After:** 
1. Fetch ALL agents from database
2. Filter in-memory for `role === "admin"`
3. Check caller's role BEFORE checking admin count
4. Better error messages

```typescript
// NEW CODE
const allAgents = await ctx.db.query("agents").collect();
const existingAdmins = allAgents.filter(agent => agent.role === "admin");

if (existingAdmins.length > 0) {
  if (callerAgent.role !== "admin") {
    throw new Error("Unauthorized: Only existing admins can grant admin access");
  }
}
```

## 🧪 Testing Steps

### Test 1: First Admin (Bootstrap) ✅

**Steps:**
1. **Clear database** (if testing fresh)
   ```bash
   # In Convex dashboard, delete all agents with role="admin"
   ```

2. **Sign in with Account #1**
   - Use your primary email
   - Create agent profile if needed

3. **Visit `/admin-setup`**
   - Should see "Admin Access Request" page
   - Click "Grant Admin Access"

4. **Expected Result:** ✅
   ```
   Success! Admin role granted to [your-email]
   isFirstAdmin: true
   Redirects to /admin
   ```

5. **Verify:**
   - Visit `/admin` - should work
   - Check database - your agent should have `role: "admin"`

---

### Test 2: Second User (Should FAIL) ❌

**Steps:**
1. **Sign OUT of Account #1**

2. **Sign in with Account #2**
   - Use different email (test account)
   - Create agent profile if needed

3. **Visit `/admin-setup`**
   - Should see "Admin Access Request" page
   - Click "Grant Admin Access"

4. **Expected Result:** ❌
   ```
   Error: Unauthorized: Only existing admins can grant admin access. 
   Contact an existing admin for access.
   ```

5. **Verify:**
   - Should show error message
   - Should NOT grant admin access
   - Visit `/admin` - should redirect or show unauthorized
   - Check database - should still have `role: undefined` or `role: "agent"`

---

### Test 3: Admin Grants to Another User ✅

**Steps:**
1. **Sign in with Account #1** (your admin account)

2. **Visit `/admin-setup`**

3. **Enter Account #2's email** in the form
   - Type the email of test account
   - Click "Grant Admin Access"

4. **Expected Result:** ✅
   ```
   Success! Admin role granted to [test-email]
   isFirstAdmin: false
   ```

5. **Verify:**
   - Sign in as Account #2
   - Visit `/admin` - should work now
   - Check database - Account #2 should have `role: "admin"`

---

### Test 4: Unauthenticated User ❌

**Steps:**
1. **Sign OUT completely**

2. **Visit `/admin-setup`**
   - Should redirect to sign-in

3. **If you bypass and try to call function:**
   ```
   Error: Not authenticated
   ```

## 🔍 How to Check Database

### Using Convex Dashboard

1. Go to https://dashboard.convex.dev
2. Select your project
3. Click "Data" tab
4. Click "agents" table
5. Look for `role` field on each agent:
   - `"admin"` = Admin user ✅
   - `undefined` or `"agent"` = Regular user
   - Should only see ONE admin initially (you)

### Expected Data

**After Test 1 (First Admin):**
```json
{
  "_id": "...",
  "email": "your-email@example.com",
  "role": "admin",  // ← Should be set
  "plan": "enterprise",
  "isActive": true
}
```

**After Test 2 (Second User Blocked):**
```json
// Test account should still be:
{
  "_id": "...",
  "email": "test@example.com",
  "role": undefined,  // ← Should NOT have admin
  "active": true
}
```

**After Test 3 (Admin Grants Access):**
```json
// Test account now has:
{
  "_id": "...",
  "email": "test@example.com",
  "role": "admin",  // ← Now granted by admin
  "plan": "enterprise",
  "isActive": true
}
```

## 🚨 What to Look For

### Security Issues

**🔴 FAIL if:**
- Second user CAN grant themselves admin
- Unauthenticated user can access function
- Regular agent can grant admin to anyone
- Error messages are unclear
- No redirect to sign-in when not authenticated

**🟢 PASS if:**
- Only first user OR existing admins can grant
- Clear error messages for unauthorized attempts
- Proper redirects
- Database correctly updated
- Activity logs show who granted access

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Second user still granted admin

**Debug Steps:**
1. Check if first admin was actually created:
   ```
   // In Convex dashboard, query:
   agents.filter(a => a.role === "admin")
   // Should return 1 result
   ```

2. Check if second user's agent has role field:
   ```
   // Look at second user's agent record
   // role should be undefined or "agent", NOT "admin"
   ```

3. Clear Convex functions cache:
   ```bash
   npx convex dev --once
   ```

### Issue: Error "Caller is not an agent"

**Solution:**
- Make sure user has created agent profile
- Visit `/dashboard` first to create profile
- Then try `/admin-setup` again

### Issue: First admin not working

**Solution:**
1. Clear all admin roles from database
2. Restart Convex dev: `npx convex dev --once`
3. Hard refresh browser (Cmd+Shift+R / Ctrl+Shift+R)
4. Try again

## 🎓 Understanding the Security

### Why This Works

**Layer 1: Authentication**
```typescript
const identity = await ctx.auth.getUserIdentity();
if (!identity) throw new Error("Not authenticated");
```
- Clerk verifies the user
- Only signed-in users can proceed

**Layer 2: Agent Verification**
```typescript
const callerAgent = await getCallerAgent();
if (!callerAgent) throw new Error("Caller is not an agent");
```
- User must have agent profile
- Links Clerk user to agent record

**Layer 3: Admin Check**
```typescript
const existingAdmins = allAgents.filter(a => a.role === "admin");
if (existingAdmins.length > 0 && callerAgent.role !== "admin") {
  throw new Error("Unauthorized");
}
```
- If admins exist, caller must be admin
- If no admins, allow (bootstrap)

### Why Previous Version Failed

**Problem:**
```typescript
// OLD - Used index query
const existingAdmins = await ctx.db
  .query("agents")
  .filter((q) => q.eq(q.field("role"), "admin"))
  .collect();
```
- Index might not catch all cases
- `role` field might be undefined
- Filter happened in database, not memory

**Solution:**
```typescript
// NEW - Fetch all, filter in memory
const allAgents = await ctx.db.query("agents").collect();
const existingAdmins = allAgents.filter(agent => agent.role === "admin");
```
- Fetch ALL agents
- Filter in JavaScript (more reliable)
- Handles undefined/null roles

## 📞 Support

**If you encounter issues:**

1. Check Convex console for errors
2. Review `/admin/logs` for activity
3. Verify database state in Convex dashboard
4. Try clearing browser cache
5. Test with incognito/private window

**Still stuck?**
- The fix is in `convex/admin/setup.ts`
- The logic starts at line ~15
- Look for "existingAdmins" variable
