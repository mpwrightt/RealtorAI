# Phase 16: Dashboard Detail Pages

**Goal:** Add comprehensive detail pages for buyers, sellers, and listings to view analytics and stats without navigating to portals

**Timeline:** 1 week (32 hours)  
**Priority:** üî•üî• HIGH  
**Status:** Pending  
**Depends On:** Phase 15 (Revenue Features)

---

## üìã Overview

This phase adds dedicated detail pages within the dashboard for quick access to buyer, seller, and listing analytics. Instead of clicking through to buyer/seller portals to see stats, agents can view comprehensive information directly from the dashboard tables.

---

## üéØ Objectives

1. **Listing Detail Pages** - Comprehensive property stats, engagement, offers, and connected sessions
2. **Seller Session Detail Pages** - Portal analytics, property overview, and quick actions
3. **Buyer Session Detail Pages** - Activity metrics, preferences, engagement history, and offers
4. **Enhanced Tables** - Make table rows clickable to navigate to detail pages
5. **Quick Actions** - Context-specific actions on each detail page
6. **AI Insights** - Intelligent recommendations and analysis on detail pages

---

## üí° User Benefits

- Agents must scroll through long tables to find information
- No quick way to see comprehensive stats about a specific buyer/seller/listing
- Must navigate to buyer/seller portals (opening new tabs) to view analytics
- Difficult to get a holistic view of activity and engagement

### Solution:
- **One-click access** to detailed stats from dashboard tables
- **Unified view** of all relevant information in one place
- **Quick actions** contextual to each entity type
- **AI insights** to understand patterns and take action
- **Better navigation** with breadcrumbs and back links
