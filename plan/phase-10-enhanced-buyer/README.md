# Phase 10: Enhanced Buyer Features (Solo Agent Focus)

**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Timeline:** 1-2 weeks (simplified)  
**Dependencies:** Phase 1-9 (completed)

## üéØ For Solo Agents
Features that **delight buyers** and make you look professional, without adding complexity to your workflow. Most features are buyer self-service.

## Overview
Advanced buyer tools including mortgage tracking, neighborhood info, virtual tours, and simple agent chat. **Removed:** Complex sharing and moving features (nice but not critical).

## Features Summary (Revised for Solo Agents)

### 3. Virtual Tour Embed - **KEEP (Very Simple)**
**Priority:** Low | **Effort:** Tiny (0.5 days)

- That's it. Just a simple iframe.
- ~~Complex measurement tools~~ (removed - Matterport has this)
