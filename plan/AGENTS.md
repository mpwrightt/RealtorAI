## Working with Tasks

### Starting a Task
1. Read entire task file first
2. Note dependencies and prerequisites
3. Set up any required tools or services
4. Create branch if using git: `git checkout -b task-X.X`

### During Implementation
1. Follow subtasks in order
2. Check off each subtask when complete
3. Test incrementally
4. Commit frequently with clear messages
5. Reference task numbers in commits

### Completing a Task
1. Review acceptance criteria
2. Run testing checklist
3. Test edge cases
4. Document any deviations or issues
5. Mark task as complete
6. Move to next task

## Task Dependencies

### Critical Path
Must be completed in order:
1. Phase 1 â†’ Phase 2 â†’ Phase 3
2. Phase 2.2 (OpenRouter) required for Phase 3.3 (AI Chat)
3. Phase 2.1 (Convex) required for all frontend phases

### Parallelizable Tasks
Can be done simultaneously:
- Phase 3 (Buyer) + Phase 4 (Seller)
- Component development within phases
- Testing alongside development

## Estimation Guidelines

### Time Estimates
- **2-3 hours** - Simple setup or configuration
- **4-6 hours** - Medium complexity features
- **6-8 hours** - Complex features with multiple components
- **8-10 hours** - Large features or integrations
- **10-12 hours** - Complex integrations (AG-UI)

### Adjust for:
- Your experience level
- Familiarity with stack
- Debugging time
- Testing thoroughness

## MVP vs Full Build

### Minimum Viable (6 weeks)
Focus on:
- Phase 1 (Foundation)
- Phase 2 (Backend)
- Phase 3 (Buyer Portal)
- Basic AG-UI (streaming only)
- Essential testing
- Simple deployment

Skip or simplify:
- Seller portal
- Agent dashboard
- Full AG-UI features
- Comprehensive testing

### Full Featured (11 weeks)
Complete all 8 phases with:
- All features
- Full AG-UI integration
- Comprehensive testing
- Production-ready deployment

## Progress Tracking

### Use Checkboxes
Each subtask has a checkbox `- [ ]`:
- Uncheck: `- [ ]` Task pending
- Check: `- [x]` Task complete

### Track in Git
```bash
# Create task branch
git checkout -b task-1.1

# Commit progress
git commit -m "task-1.1: Complete subtask 1.1.3"

# Mark complete
git commit -m "task-1.1: Complete âœ“"
```

### Document Issues
If you encounter problems:
1. Document in task file
2. Create GitHub issue (if using)
3. Note workarounds or solutions
4. Update troubleshooting section

## Best Practices

### Before Starting
- Read entire task file
- Understand dependencies
- Gather required resources
- Set up development environment

### During Development
- Follow subtasks sequentially
- Test incrementally
- Commit frequently
- Document decisions
- Ask for help when stuck

### After Completion
- Verify acceptance criteria
- Run full testing checklist
- Update documentation
- Clean up code
- Prepare for next task

## Common Patterns

### Task File Reading
1. **Skim overview** - Get big picture
2. **Check dependencies** - Ensure prerequisites met
3. **Read subtasks** - Understand detailed steps
4. **Review code examples** - See implementation patterns
5. **Note acceptance criteria** - Know when you're done

### Code Implementation
1. **Read code examples in task file**
2. **Adapt to your specific needs**
3. **Test as you build**
4. **Follow style guidelines**
5. **Add comments for complex logic**

### Testing
1. **Test each subtask**
2. **Run integration tests after task**
3. **Check edge cases**
4. **Verify error handling**
5. **Test on different browsers/devices**

## Troubleshooting

### Task Seems Unclear
- Re-read task overview
- Check code examples
- Review referenced files
- Consult main documentation
- Ask for clarification

### Stuck on Subtask
- Review previous subtasks
- Check for missing dependencies
- Read error messages carefully
- Test with simplified example
- Break down into smaller steps

### Time Estimate Off
- Don't rush - quality over speed
- Document time spent
- Adjust future estimates
- Take breaks when needed
