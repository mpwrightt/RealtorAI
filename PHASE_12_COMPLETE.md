## 🎉 What Was Built

Phase 12 focused on agent communication tools. We built a complete SMS campaign system that allows agents to send bulk SMS messages to their clients about new listings, price drops, and open houses.

### ✅ Feature: SMS Campaigns
**Route:** `/dashboard/sms-campaigns`  
**Status:** ✅ Complete (with Twilio integration)

**What It Does:**
Send bulk SMS messages to clients about listings and updates. Perfect for solo agents to stay top-of-mind with their client base.

**Core Functionality:**

1. **Create SMS Campaigns**
   - Name your campaign
   - Choose from 3 templates or write custom
   - Select recipients (all, buyers only, leads only)
   - Preview message before sending
   - Save as draft

2. **Message Templates** (Auto-generated)
   - 🏡 **New Listing** - "NEW LISTING! 3BR/2BA in Austin - $450,000..."
   - 💰 **Price Drop** - "PRICE DROP! 123 Main St now $425,000..."
   - 🏠 **Open House** - "OPEN HOUSE this weekend! 123 Main St..."
   - ✏️ **Custom** - Write your own message

3. **Smart Recipient Selection**
   - All Contacts - Everyone with phone numbers

   - Per-recipient status tracking

5. **Twilio Integration**

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Twilio Integration

**Environment Variables Required:**
```bash
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_account_sid
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_auth_token
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=+1234567890
```

**Setup Steps:**
1. Sign up at twilio.com
2. Get a phone number (~$1/month)
3. Copy Account SID and Auth Token
4. Add to .env.local
5. Start sending!

**Cost:** ~$0.01 per SMS (pay as you go)

**Simulation Mode:**
If Twilio credentials are not configured:
- Campaign still works
- Simulates sending
- Marks all as "delivered"
- Shows "simulated" flag in results
- Great for development/testing

### Backend Architecture

**Action (Twilio):**
```typescript
export const sendCampaign = action({
  args: { campaignId: v.id("smsCampaigns") },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    // Get campaign
    const campaign = await ctx.runQuery(...)
    
    // Update status to "sending"
    await ctx.runMutation(...)
    
    // Send via Twilio (or simulate)
    if (twilioConfigured) {
      const twilio = require('twilio')
      const client = twilio(sid, token)
      
      for (recipient of recipients) {
        await client.messages.create({
          body: campaign.message,
          from: twilioNumber,
          to: recipient.phone,
        })
      }
    } else {
      // Simulate for demo
    }
    
    // Update final status
    await ctx.runMutation(...)
  }
})
```

**Key Features:**
- Graceful fallback if Twilio not configured
- Per-recipient error handling
- Status tracking throughout
- Campaign-level statistics
- Clean separation of concerns
