## üî® What's Left (Optional Polish & Deployment)

### Phase 7: Testing & Polish (Optional but Recommended)

#### 7.1 Testing Strategy
**Status:** Not started  
**Priority:** Medium (optional for MVP)

#### 8.2 Launch Preparation
**Status:** Not started  
**Priority:** High (when ready to launch)  
**Effort:** 2-3 hours

- [ ] Create user documentation
- [ ] Create onboarding flow
- [ ] Set up customer support channels
- [ ] Configure analytics (Google Analytics, Mixpanel)
- [ ] Set up email notifications (SendGrid, Resend)

## üéØ Bottom Line

**Core functionality: 100% complete ‚úÖ**

**What's left is optional:**
- Testing (good practice, not blocking)
- Optimization (already fast, can be faster)
- Nice-to-have features (can add anytime)
- Deployment (2-4 hours when ready)

**You could literally launch tomorrow with what's built!**

The question is: Do you want to polish first, or ship fast and iterate?

Both are valid strategies. Most successful startups ship MVP fast, get users, then polish based on real feedback.

---

## üìù My Recommendation

**Ship the MVP in the next 2-4 hours:**

1. Deploy to Vercel (15 min)
2. Deploy Convex to production (15 min)
3. Add production API keys (15 min)
4. Test with real data (1-2 hours)
5. Go live! üöÄ

Then:
- Get 2-3 real agents using it
- Collect feedback
- Prioritize features based on actual user needs
- Iterate quickly

This gets you to market fastest and lets users guide your roadmap.

**What do you think? Ship now or polish first?**
