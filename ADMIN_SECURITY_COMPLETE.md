## 🎯 Final Implementation

### Security Layers

**Layer 1: Authentication**
```typescript
const identity = await ctx.auth.getUserIdentity();
if (!identity) throw new Error("Not authenticated");
```
✅ Must be signed in with Clerk

**Layer 2: Agent Verification**
```typescript
const callerAgent = await getCallerAgent(identity);
if (!callerAgent) throw new Error("Caller is not an agent");
```
✅ Must have agent profile

**Layer 3: Admin Authorization**
```typescript
const allAgents = await ctx.db.query("agents").collect();
const existingAdmins = allAgents.filter(agent => agent.role === "admin");

if (existingAdmins.length > 0) {
  if (callerAgent.role !== "admin") {
    throw new Error("Unauthorized: Only existing admins can grant admin access");
  }
}
```
✅ If admins exist, caller must be admin  
✅ If no admins exist, allow bootstrap
